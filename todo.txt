* decide: how to implement grouping? chain trees of the grouped samples or combine outputs? (later has the advantage
          for gengroups that we do not need the same gen requirement for all samples)
* decide: oblist and obyields only in trees as we only have objects there? how define objects elsewhere?
* decide: how to implement primary and secondary schemes?
* decide: plot something separate or should it run every module it needs before?


* copy cfg file and log file to output directory
* read parts of the cfg file from external file (selection, tree variables, etc)
* testing-mode? publish und default mode?
* make tree run
* make plot run
* make stat run
* format of evlist
* colors only for groups
* groups database and usage in cfg file and code (groups, gengroups, datasets), col per group, gen pfx no group
* implement primary and secondary schemes
* implement histogram styles
* embedding a txt file in the config (at different columns, replacing everything from that column on)
* check config file info algorithm
* production name
* variable binning? 
* variable cross-section?
* selection from event list
* selection from histogram
* 1d plots? i.e. visualization of one value for different scenarios / selections / regions / etc. c.f. sergio's slides
* reading edm?
* graphical stuff, painting lines, regions, arrows into the plot
* fix colors, markers and line styles
* schemes for sip and fake ratio?
* eventually, cfg file for the whole analysis up to datacards and then after upper limits
